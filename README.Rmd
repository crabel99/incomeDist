## Introduction

The purpose of the attached code is to compare the fit of two different models to income data in the United States over a 25-year period. The two models examined are a modified Gibbs distribution and a modified Maxwell distribution. The modification to both of these distributions is the inclusion of a Pareto distribution to account for the shape of the right hand tails. The modification is done through a solution to the stationary Fokker-Plank equation.

The income data used is the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) taken from Table 1.1

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
